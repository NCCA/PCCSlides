### Writing Slides with Markdown

- press the right arrow key to continue


---

### Overview

- This slide set will show examples of how to write slides using markdown
- It will also include some of the more complex elements where you need to embed html or javascript
- This can be used along with the index.html file as a starting point / reference
- **now press the down key!**

--

## Navigation 

- Use the arrow keys to move between slides
- Pressing the ```s``` key will open the speaker notes
- Pressing the ```f``` key will open full screen mode
- Pressing the ```b``` key will open a black screen
- Pressing the ```ESC``` will give full overview of slides

Note:
  The notes keyword is used to add speaker notes to a slide. 
  These notes are not visible to the audience.
  Note the new line and the Tabs

--

### Menu Button

- The home button at the top left returns to the first slide, but can be altered to go to a different url if required
- The menu button at the bottom left opens a menu with many options including themes 

--


### Structure of slides

- I tend to group topics into vertical sections each slide has a ```--``` to separate them in the markdown file
- Horizontal slides are created using the ```---``` separator and I use these for core heading topics 
- Make sure the spaces are correct or the slide will not render correctly you basically need a blank line between each slide

---


### Part One basic reveal.js

- Bullets are easy you just use the ```-``` symbol
- You can also use numbers
  - Indentation is used to create sub bullets
  - You can also use numbers

--

### numbers

1. This is a numbered list
2. This is the second item
  1. This is a sub item
  2. This is another sub item
3. This is the third item

--

## fragments (press down!)

* Fragments are used to animate items on a slide press right to continue <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* I tend not to use these <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* but you can add them if you wish <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* they can be used to reveal items one at a time <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
  If using a markdown file you need to add the element tags to get it to render correctly

--

## more complex fragments

* default is fade in <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* highlight red <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-red" -->
* fade in then out <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" -->
* slide up while fading in <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
* slide down while fading in <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-down" -->
* slide left while fading in <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-left" -->
* slide right while fading in <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-right" -->

## Tables

- Tables are created using markdown

| operation | Result |
|--------|-------|
| ``` x+y``` | sum of x and y |
| ``` x-y``` | difference of x and y |
| ``` x*y``` | product of x and y |
| ``` x/y``` | quotient of x and y |
| ``` x//y``` | floored quotient of x and y |

## images

- Images are embedded using the markdown syntax ```![alt text](url)```

## images

- finer control can be achieved using html

# Quotes

- You can use block quotes to highlight text, the markdown one tends to be quite large html gives finer control

<blockquote><small><p>Turner Whittedâ€™s original paper on ray tracing (1980) emphasized its recursive nature, which was the key that made it possible to include indirect specular reflection and transmission in rendered images.</p></small></blockquote>

--

# Videos 

- Videos can be embedded using standard html, to avoid large files on github I have used a youtube link
 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KrCh5qD9Ho" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


---

## Code

- Code can be embedded in the slides using the markdown triple single backtick 
- It can be inline like ```this``` or a block like below

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
```

--

# Code

- The code can be syntax highlighted using the language name after the first set of backticks
- There is also an option to full screen the code block
- This is static code which can also be cut and pasted easily to a terminal etc. 

```python
print("Hello World")
```

---

#### Runable Python (using PyScript)

- The following code will run inline python, we need a target div to display the output
- Note we need a unique div name for each code block

```python
<script type="py-editor" target="editor1">
import this
</script>
<div id="editor1" style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left; overflow:scroll; height:250px;"></div>
```

<script type="py-editor" target="editor1">
import this
</script>
<div id="editor1" style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left; overflow:scroll; height:250px;"></div>


--

# Code from file

- Code can be loaded from a file it will be placed in the text edit
- note the size and scroll bars are set in the div

```python
<script type="py-editor" src="code/python.py"  target="editor2"></script>
<div id="editor2" style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left; overflow-y: scroll; height:400px;"></div>
```

--

## Code from file

<script type="py-editor" src="code/python.py"  target="editor2"></script>
<div id="editor2" style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left; overflow-y: scroll; height:400px;"></div>

## [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)

- we can record terminal sessions and embed them in the slides
- emebedding is done using the asciinema-player element

```
<asciinema-player src="example.asc" cols=120 rows=10></asciinema-player>
```

<asciinema-player src="example.asc" cols=120 rows=10></asciinema-player>

--

## [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)

- it is possible to edit the recorded files if you make a mistake 
- I also have a tool that allows minimal edits / re-timings for the files
- This is on github [here](https://github.com/NCCA/AsciinemaEdit) 

---

## math notation

- Math notation is rendered with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) as we are using markdown we need the delimiters  ``` `$$ ```
- plain text needs to use ```\text{}``` to render correctly

`$$ \text{When } a \ne 0, \text{there are two solutions to } \\\\ ax^2 + bx + c = 0  \text{ and they are } \\\\ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}  $$`

--

## Math notation

- The math plugin is set to the default TeX-AMS_HTML-full so most LaTex should work fine.


`$$
tx=\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) \\\
sin(\theta) & cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}
$$`


---

### Processing 

- web based processing can be added, It is best to do it in a separate file and then embed it in the slide

<div class="stretch">
<iframe width="900" height="90%" src="add.html"></iframe>
</div>
